# Tank Game

This game, currently unnamed, will be our attempt to follow along with Ben
Tristem's Unreal Engine Class.

This project is being developped solely for the purpose of learning how to use
UE4, and as such doesn't really have any goals or intentions of use. You are
welcome to use the code and assets here distributed within. If you want to know
more about the game itself, check the design documents within, although these
are likely to change.

## Roadmap

Our project has just started. As such, we have several basic tasks that need to
be finished:

- [x] Have the git pipeline completely set up in both of our machines.
- [x] Create the project in Unreal and commit it.
- [x] Set up the basic game terrain.
- [ ] Create a basic tank model and add it in as an actor.
- [ ] Create a basic tank control scheme.
- [ ] Implement shooting and damage.
- [ ] Create a HUD that shows how damaged the tank is, how much ammo it still has and such.
- [ ] Finish the design document.
